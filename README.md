# Wearable Device Store Management System
## Overview
This system simulates the management of wearable devices, specifically focusing on devices like smartwatches and smart bands. The software allows the store to handle and interact with different wearable devices by providing functionalities such as calculating insurance premiums, validating device attributes (e.g., display types, manufacturers), and managing user input. The system is controlled and maintained from a basic command line interface.
